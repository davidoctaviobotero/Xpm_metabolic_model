class Update:
    """
    The standard input for this class is a dictionnart of metabolites and coefficients where:
    keys = metabolites
    values = coefficients
    CobraPy supports easily this kind of format to update reactions.
    Since no real standard exists in BiGG to exists to annotate the Biomass Objective Function:
    - Either the name of the biomass objective function should be provided by the user or
    - Default = the model takes the current objective reaction and updates it with the current metabolites
